description: Two-axis review (Standards and Spec) of a diff against a fixed point, run as parallel sub-agents. Use after building, or when the user asks to review a branch, PR, or changes since X.
---

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point:

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Use the fixed point the caller or user gave (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If none was given, use the `Base:` SHA of the spec under `docs/specs/` whose `Branch:` matches the current branch. If there is no such spec, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside two parallel sub-agents.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. What the caller passed: a spec path, or (inline mode) the G1 summary.
2. The `docs/specs/<slug>/` whose `Branch:` matches the current branch, or whose slug matches the branch name: its `spec.md` plus every ticket file under `tickets/`.
3. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written: `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`. On top of those, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** in [SMELLS.md](SMELLS.md), with its two rules: the repo overrides the baseline, and smells are always judgement calls.

### 4. Spawn both sub-agents in parallel

**Standards sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the full text of SMELLS.md** pasted in (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The spec and ticket paths, or the G1 summary text in inline mode.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Keep each axis's findings separate and in its own order, because the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Name a worst issue per axis rather than a single winner across axes: a cross-axis winner is the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

Done when both axes have reported (or the Spec axis is recorded as skipped) and the summary line names a count and a worst issue for each.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the spec asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
