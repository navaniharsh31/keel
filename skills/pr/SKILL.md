Use this template for writing the PR body:

```markdown
## Summary

<diagram, diff-sketch, or tree>

## Evidence

- **Before:** <screenshot/output/failing test run>
  **After:** <screenshot/output/passing test run>

## Merge Danger

**Door:** <one-way or two-way>

<optional: description>

**Blast Radius:** <one-word description>

<optional: potential ramifications of merge>
```

## Sections

Skip all preambles and keep prose brief. Use the user's domain language from `GLOSSARY.md`.

### Summary

Pick the smallest view that makes the key point clear. Choose it from the menu in [VISUALS.md](VISUALS.md) (pseudocode, call tree, component tree, file tree, Mermaid, diff, whole block), and read that file before writing the section.

### Evidence

Concrete evidence that the change works. Show a before and after.

Screenshots are S-tier - when the environment is set up for it and the change is visual.

Execution-based evidence is A-tier. Test results, console output. Show the exact test that now fails and passes, using pseudocode.

### Merge Danger

Describe whether it's a one-way or two-way door. You can walk back through two-way doors, but not one-way doors. A PR that is cheap to roll back is lower risk. Changes that involve destructive actions or hard-to-reverse decisions are one-way doors.

The blast radius is the potential impact or scope of the changes introduced by this PR. Consider all possibilities. Examples are layout shift, breakages for consumers, mobile responsiveness, etc.

Done when every template section is filled: a Summary visual, a before and an after under Evidence, and a door and blast radius under Merge Danger.

## Opening the PR

Run `gh pr create` only after the user picked *Open a PR* at keel:build's finish step, or asked for a PR directly. Until then, the body is a draft shown to the user.
